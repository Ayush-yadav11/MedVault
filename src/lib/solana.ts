// This file is for Solana related utilities.
// Getting the current user's wallet on the server side in Next.js App Router
// without a proper session management that stores the wallet is tricky.
// The wallet connection is primarily a client-side concern with @solana/wallet-adapter.

// For server actions, the wallet public key needs to be passed as an argument from the client.
// For server components rendering pages, if they need to be aware of the wallet,
// this usually happens via:
// 1. Client component fetching data using the wallet, then passing to server component (not typical).
// 2. Page being a client component itself.
// 3. A server-side session mechanism (e.g., using cookies after initial wallet connection/signing a message).

// For this MVP, server actions will receive the public key.
// Pages that need to display user-specific data and are server components
// will have a client component child that fetches the data.

/**
 * Placeholder/Conceptual: Get current user's wallet public key.
 * In a real app, this would involve reading from a secure server-side session
 * established after wallet authentication (e.g. sign-in with Solana).
 * For this MVP, critical actions requiring wallet ID will get it passed from client,
 * or client components will use `useWallet` hook.

  // Since this is a server utility, it cannot directly access client-side hooks.
